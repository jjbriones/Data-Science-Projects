{"cells":[{"source":"![car](car.jpg)\n\nInsurance companies invest a lot of [time and money](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-84/accenture-machine-leaning-insurance.pdf) into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n\nKnowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n\nThey have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below.","metadata":{},"id":"c3f0e974-faf8-458f-bf2a-06a469d0ea5e","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"\n\n## The dataset\n\n| Column | Description
