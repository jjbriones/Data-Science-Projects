There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools =
